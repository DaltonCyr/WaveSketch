Inputing Values

  : Values for voltage, frequency, and
    shift are entered by taping the desired
    corresponding input box. A key board will
    appear and you can input your value. To
    exit the keyboard, just tap anywhere out
    of the keyboard

Selecting Units

  : Data units are changed by scrolling.
    Just put your finger on top of the unit
    you want to change and slide up or down
    and you will see the unit change

Voltage Values

  : For the voltage, +5V to -5V is the
    range.
    
  : When selecting mV the range
    is +5000 mV to -5000 mV.
    
  : To get a negative voltage value select
    the voltage unit's - V or - mV.
    
  : Only on GuideSketch DC can the Max V
    and the Min V be equal. Any other
    time the voltages must have at least
    a 10 mV difference
    
Frequency Values

    : When selecting Hz unit, the frequency ranges
      are 1 to 100000 Hz.
    
    : When selecting kHz unit, the frequency ranges
      are 0.001 to 100 kHz
    
    : No values less than 1 Hz are supported
    
    : The DC wave option in GuideSketch still needs
      a frequency
    
Shift Values

    : When NO Shift is desired, you must input a
      "0" for the shift value and select the unit
      "N/A" for not applicable
    
    : When a Directional Shift is desired, you
      must input the absolute value of the shift
      degree and select a direction "Left" or "Right"
      
    : "N/A" can not be the unit of a directional shift.

Channel Selection

    : Currently the WaveSketch only supports dual
      channel output.
      
    : Choosing the correct channel is important. If
      you want to have two unique wave outputting at
      the same time they must have different select
      channels when you make the wave.
      
    : "CH 1" selection corresponds to BNC Jack 1.
      "CH 2" selection corresponds to BNC Jack 2.
