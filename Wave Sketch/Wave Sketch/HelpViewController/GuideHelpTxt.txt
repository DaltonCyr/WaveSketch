Wave Types

  : Square Wave - is a wave that has a high
    voltage value for half of it's period
    and then a low voltage value for the
    other half of the period. WaveSketch
    requires a 10 mV difference between the
    high and low voltage values chosen.

  : Triangle Wave - is a wave that has a
    positive ramp up and down triangle look
    for the first half of the period and then
    has a negative ramp down and up triangle
    look in the second half of the other half.
    WaveSketch requires a 10 mV difference
    between the Max and Min voltages.

  : Sawtooth Wave - is a wave that ramps up
    the entire period than immediately goes down
    at the end of the period. WaveSketch requires
    a 10 mV difference between the Max and Min
    voltages.

  : Trapezoidal Wave - is a wave that ramps up,
    then has a flat section, and ramps down in the
    first half of the period. In the second half of
    period the wave ramps down, has a flat section,
    then ramps back up. WaveSketch requires a
    10 mV difference between the Max and Min
    voltages.

  : DC Wave - is a mimic of a DC Voltage.
    It stays at the same voltage the entire period.
    The entered Max & Min voltages must be equal.
    This is the only wave that WaveSketch allows the
    Max and Min Voltage to be the same.

  : Sinusoidal Wave - is a upside down parabola
    ramping up then down for the first half of
    the period, and then a parabola ramping down
    then up for the second half of the period.
    WaveSketch requires a 10 mV difference
    between the Max & Min voltages.

Saving GuideSketch Waves

  : Save Button - To correctly save a GuideSketch
    wave, all of the wave inputs and units must
    be inputed, all values and units must be in
    the supported ranges, and a wave must be
    selected to save. If something is missing
    an Error alert will show the missing
    information.

  : Wave File Name - The user can choose to input
    a customized name inside of the file name input
    box or opt out by just pressing save. The app
    will always save your wave with the type of
    WaveSketch and an unique identifier attached
    to the end of the name.
  
  : File Location - All of the files saved from
    app will be saved into a WavesSketch File
    located in your files app. To access them,
    starting from the home screen, tap the file
    app. Then select "On My iPhone" under the
    location tab. A screen of files will appear
    and select the WaveSketch File. All of
    the saved wave files are located here.
    
Clearing Drawing / Inputs

  : To clear a selected wave drawing press
    the clear button at the top left of the
    screen. To clear the input data and reset
    the units double tap the clear button at
    the top left of the screen.
